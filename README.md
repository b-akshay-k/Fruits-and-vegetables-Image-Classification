# Fruits and Vegetables Image Classification CNN Project
![Fruits and Vegetables Classification](images/Untitled design.jpg")
## Overview
This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying images of fruits and vegetables. The goal is to accurately identify and categorize different types of fruits and vegetables based on input images.

### Features
Data preprocessing and augmentation
CNN model architecture using TensorFlow/Keras
Model training and evaluation
Visualization of training results
Inference on new images
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
TensorFlow 2.x
Keras
NumPy
Matplotlib
OpenCV
scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fruits-vegetables-classification.git
 cd fruits-vegetables-classification

3. Create a virtual environment:
   python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

4. Install the required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
